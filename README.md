# Turing-Tickets

## Known Bugs

- fix styles for add_admin.php

HTML

I have utilized HTML extensively in my projects to structure and design web pages. For example, I used HTML to build this portfolio and my Turing Tickets project, where it served as the foundation for organizing content and creating user-friendly layouts.

PHP

PHP has been a critical tool in my projects where database integration was required. I used PHP to write SQL queries, enabling dynamic content generation and interactions with databases. This allowed me to build efficient systems for data storage and retrieval, such as in projects requiring user management or ticketing systems.

Java

In my development workflow, Java has been instrumental in defining functionality for web applications. I leveraged Java to implement features on the client side and combined it with PHP to pass data between databases and webpages. This collaboration ensures that applications are interactive, responsive, and capable of meeting user needs.

CSS

CSS has been a significant part of my web development process, used to enhance the visual appeal of websites. While I prioritize functionality in my designs, I ensure my projects have a clean and organized look. CSS allows me to create visually consistent interfaces that complement the structure provided by HTML.

YAML

My experience with YAML began with my work on Home Assistant, where handwritten code was essential for configurations. YAML taught me the importance of precision in syntax and structured data representation. This foundational experience gave me confidence in managing code for automation and scripting tasks.

Service Work

In addition to technical skills, I have a background in service-oriented work, where I learned to prioritize user needs, troubleshoot issues effectively, and deliver solutions under pressure. This experience has honed my ability to create user-focused web applications and maintain strong communication and problem-solving skills.
